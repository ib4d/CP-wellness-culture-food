**INITIAL PROMPT:**

Project Food & Health

I'm working in a project with my girlfriend. We want to create a business based on our common passions that are related to sustainable health-life-balance, cuisine (cuban and polish), cooking interesting healthy recipees, cuban and polish culture (lore, mistique, afrocuban religion \-NO CATHOLIC AND EUROPEAN'S RELATED), story telling, music, and dancing (especially cuban rythms). You already know my background. In Gosia's case, she is Fisyo Therapist and Dietetist, sharing same passions like me for making new relations, open minded, very energetic-polite-good-humoristic person, possitive and full of joy.

\# The idea is to build our brand around the merge of all our common (and separated experiences from both our professional worlds: marketing, sales, spanish lessons, health care, public relations, ppl persons, cultural topics, cooking, art \-we both love drawing/painting-, and awesome human relations). We want to create a space for ppl to enjoy and make there lifes better by introducing a much more healthy-balanced diet based on cuban cuisine with products that we can easily (and sometimes not so much) find in polish markets, with a very strong digital interaction and interface (thinking for expansion in further stages to fisical space as well). Also a great purpose to sensitivicise polish ppl on learning spanish in a humoristic way and make the learning curve/path more enjoyable.

\#\# PROJECT ASPECTS:

\- digital platform to sell, promote, and experiment a healthy life style, based on cientistic and popular knowledge

\- cooking cuban and polish dishes based on specific diet targetting and personalizing them for each individual

\- main products: cuban/polish dishes (from desserts to main ones, all), delivering on-demmand services, personalized packages for each client (notes, humor, quotes, and small tips for learning spanish language), trainings based on dance, fisyotherapy, personalized diets, e-books, drawing books for children, book writting (we want to create engaging stories for ppl to learn about cuban culture), \-YOU CAN SUGGEST MORE RELATED-

\- a special will to cooperation with other related businesses and sponsors to expand our network and clients

\- website build: landing page with strong hero section and calls to action, programs incorporated displayed, dietetist services, fysiotherapy services, health advices services, dance lessons, fysiotherapy excercices services, health tips, \-YOU CAN SUGGEST MORE RELATED-

\- dashboard to manage all business enqueries: client interaction, finances, statistics, Q\&A's,

\- usage of social media to promote our programs: tik-tok, instagram, linkedin, youtube

\- mobile app building for easier engagement and access for clients

\- e-commerce saas for selling our brad products: e-books, drawing books, cuisine books, books with cuban stories, t-shirts and clothe, easy-to-preserve food (marmelades, battons, cereals, etc), \-ADVISE WHAT ELSE COULD BE INCLUDED-

\#\# RESTRICTIONS:

\- no political topics aloud

\- no religion oriented topic

\- no promotion of sensitive materials that can harm mentaly and fisically a person or animal or plant

\- no promotion of products sensitive for addiction: tobaco, drugs, alcohol, beverages like coca-cola and similar \-(although coffee is allowed)

\- no war and conflict topics

\#\#\# Now, based on this extense information, act as an experienced business analyst / nutritionist / fisiotherapist / health oriented individual, and provide a business plan for our enterprise from the very first steps until the execution and put on live company product deliverance.

\#\#\# Make your analysis and return coherent plan, explained sbs and in an easy way to understand, including every stage to take into account and how to better implement it from our perspective (take into account we dont have a budget yet dedicated)

\#\#\# Also bring thorough analysis on strenghths vs weaknesses on the market and niche we are introducing at, potential competitors, and strategies for beating the competition or at least do it as good as they are doing

\#\#\# Reserve for later implementation the digital business structure, excecution, development stack and so on. I want to focus first on the understanding of my business strengths vs weaknesses, and then we'll focus on the full-stack development execution

Thanks for sharing such a rich vision for your project. To tailor the business plan and market analysis more precisely, could you please clarify the following:

1. Do you plan to start by offering digital-only services (like e-books, personalized diet plans, virtual cooking/dance classes) before expanding to physical products and spaces?

2. Are there specific Polish cities or regions where you want to initially target your services?

3. Who is your primary target audience? (e.g., health-conscious adults, families with children, Spanish language learners, etc.)

4. Do you plan to work full-time on this from the beginning, or start part-time alongside other commitments?

5. What is your expected timeline for launching your MVP (minimum viable product)?

With these details, I can prepare a clear step-by-step business plan with market analysis and competitive strategies.

##### **TÃº dijiste:**

**1**. we want a merge of both physical and digital aspects since we want our prospects to personaly try our products themselves (like food, physiotherapy, diet, e-books, channels, etc) all of it. but we want to do it wisely, in a way that dont overflow our tasks and lifes and in a way the bisuness can grow organically and not rushed 

**2**. initially we want to start in Wielkopolska, Poznan, then to comprehensively expand (the world is the sky) 

**3**. yes: health-conscious adults, families with children, Spanish language learners, but also young adults establishing balanced healthy lifes, adults with health issues (food related, mobility related, rehabilitation, etc) \-feel free to include more in the list (according to our scope) 

**4**. starting alongside since we both have our current jobs, then would probably move 100% full-time 

**5**. MVP as soon as possible since we have the main requisites: we can cook, we can side-hustle social media promotion, I can develop digital product, and in general it would require a lot of initial effort, but for that reason we want to start strong but not rushing things \-think of it like different stages, waves, or phases where we will include what's needed on the precise moment
